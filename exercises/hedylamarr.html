        <strong>Hedy Lamarr</strong> born as <strong>Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler</strong>
        (November 9, 1914 – January 19, 2000) was an Austrian and American film actress and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention" target="_blank"> inventor</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
        At the beginning of World War II, Lamarr and composer George Antheil
        developed a radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, which used spread spectrum and frequency
        hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the Axis powers. Although the US Navy did not
        adopt the technology until the 1960s, the principles of their work are now incorporated into modern Wi-Fi, CDMA,
        and Bluetooth technology,and this work led to their induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2014.

      <h2><strong>Early life and Education</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler in 1914 in Vienna, Austria-Hungary,
        the only child of Gertrud "Trude" Kiesler (née Lichtwitz; 1894 – 1977) and Emil Kiesler (1880 – 1935).
        Her father was born to a Jewish family in Lemberg (now Lviv in Ukraine) and was a successful bank director.
        Her mother was a pianist and Budapest native who came from an upper-class Jewish family; she had converted
        from Judaism to Catholicism and was described as a "practicing Christian", who raised her daughter as a Christian.
        Lamarr helped get her mother out of Austria (then under Nazi domination) and to the United States.
        Her mother later became an American citizen. Gertrud Kiesler put "Hebrew" as her race on her petition for
        naturalization as an American citizen. In the late 1920s, Lamarr was discovered as an actress and brought to
        Berlin by producer Max Reinhardt.Following her training in the theater, she returned to Vienna, where she began to work in the film industry,
        first as a script girl, and soon as an actress. In early 1933, at age 18, she starred in Gustav Machatý's film,
        Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech), which was filmed in Prague. Her role was that of a neglected young
        wife married to an indifferent older man. The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr's face
        in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes, a result of her being "duped" by the director
        and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses.

          <h2><strong>Career</strong></h2>

          <p>
            After arriving in Paris in 1937, she met Louis B. Mayer, who was scouting for talent in Europe.[18] Mayer persuaded her to change her name to Hedy Lamarr (she had been known as "the Ecstasy lady"), choosing the surname in homage to the beautiful silent film star, Barbara La Marr. He brought her to Hollywood in 1938 and began promoting her as the "world's most beautiful woman".

Lamarr made her American film debut in Algiers (1938), opposite Charles Boyer. The film created a "national sensation," says Shearer. She was billed as an unknown but well-publicized Austrian actress, which created anticipation in audiences. Mayer hoped she would become another Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich. According to one viewer, when her face first appeared on the screen, "everyone gasped...Lamarr's beauty literally took one's breath away."

In future Hollywood films, she was invariably typecast as the archetypal glamorous seductress of exotic origin. Lamarr played opposite the era's most popular leading men. Her many films included Boom Town (1940) with Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, Comrade X with Gable, White Cargo (1942), Tortilla Flat (1942) with Tracy and John Garfield, H. M. Pulham, Esq. (1941) with Robert Young, and Dishonored Lady (1947). In 1941, Lamarr was cast alongside Lana Turner and Judy Garland in Ziegfeld Girl.

Her off-screen life and personality during those years was quite different from what audiences assumed. She spent much of her time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent's pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression:

Hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them; and she forces herself to be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve.


Victor Mature and Lamarr in Samson and Delilah (1949)
Lamarr made 18 films from 1940 to 1949, and also had two children during that time (in 1945 and 1947). After leaving MGM in 1945, she enjoyed her biggest success as Delilah in Cecil B. DeMille's Samson and Delilah, the highest-grossing film of 1949, with Victor Mature as the Biblical strongman. However, following a comedic role opposite Bob Hope in My Favorite Spy (1951), her career went into decline. She appeared only sporadically in films after 1950, one of her last roles being that of Joan of Arc in Irwin Allen's critically panned epic, The Story of Mankind (1957). White Cargo, one of Lamarr's biggest hits at MGM, contains arguably her most memorable film quote, delivered with provocative invitation: "I am Tondelayo. I make tiffin for you?" This line typifies many of Lamarr's roles, which emphasized her beauty and sensuality while giving her relatively few lines. The lack of acting challenges bored Lamarr. She reportedly took up inventing to relieve her boredom.

Author Richard Rhodes describes her assimilation into American culture:

Of all the European émigrés who escaped Nazi Germany and Nazi Austria, she was one of the very few who succeeded in moving to another culture and becoming a full-fledged star herself. There were so very few who could make the transition linguistically or culturally. She really was a resourceful human being–I think because of her father’s strong influence on her as a child.

              <h2><strong>Inventor</strong></h2>

              <p>
                Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught, she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions, which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink. The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka-Seltzer.

Among the few who knew of Lamarr's inclination to inventiveness was aviation tycoon Howard Hughes. Lamarr discussed her relationship with Hughes during an interview, saying that while they dated he actively supported her "tinkering" hobbies. He put his team of science engineers at her disposal, saying they would do or make anything she asked for.

On one occasion, Hughes was trying to modify his aircraft designs to make planes fly faster. He asked her for ideas; "He relied on me," she said. Lamarr began studying the aerodynamics of birds and the shapes of fishes, afterward presenting him with sketched ideas to make wings on planes less square and more efficient. "[I] showed it to Howard Hughes and he said, 'You’re a genius.'"

During World War II, Lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes, which could be important in the naval war, could easily be jammed, thereby causing the torpedo to go off course. With the knowledge she had gained about torpedoes from her first husband, she came up with the idea of somehow creating a frequency-hopping signal that could not be tracked or jammed. She contacted her friend, composer and pianist George Antheil, to help her develop a device for doing that, and he succeeded by synchronizing a miniaturized player-piano mechanism with radio signals. They drafted designs for the frequency-hopping system which they patented. Antheil recalls:

We began talking about the war, which, in the late summer of 1940, was looking most extremely black. Hedy said that she did not feel very comfortable, sitting there in Hollywood and making lots of money when things were in such a state. She said that she knew a good deal about munitions and various secret weapons . . . and that she was thinking seriously of quitting M.G.M. and going to Washington, D.C., to offer her services to the newly established Inventors’ Council.

Their invention was granted a patent on August 11, 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey). However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at that time the U.S. Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military. Only in 1962 (at the time of the Cuban missile crisis) did an updated version of their design appear on Navy ships. The design is one of the important elements behind today's spread-spectrum communication technology, such as modern CDMA, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth technology.[5][21]

In 1997, they received the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award and the Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Bronze Award, given to individuals whose creative lifetime achievements in the arts, sciences, business, or invention fields have significantly contributed to society. She was featured on the Science Channel and the Discovery Channel.[10] In 2014, Lamarr and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
